# TicTacToe

I have created this TicTacToe game as JAVA project for college.

This is two player console game.
I have used two dimensional array to store characters for grid (board). Grid is divided into nine fields.
When player enters his character (X or O) he has to choose number 1 to 9 associated with position on grid. Every number is verified if it really is number between 1 and 9 and 
position on grid is also verified if to be free.
Score is tracked through game, and displayed after every game.
